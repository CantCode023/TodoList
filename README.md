Todo List is an app made by Blue Duck#8344 for educational purposes.

# How it works

Todo List app will ask for an input for a new todo, using JavaScript, we could take the input and add it to the todo list.

Todo List can also store your todos to a local storage so you don't have to worry about missing todos!
